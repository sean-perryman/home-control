#Home Theater Control

Controlling home theater devices with readily-accessible IP based control hardware, and python scripts for right now.
The ultimate goal here is to get this all working with Python scripts, then either set it up as a web-based API or take the logic into a compiled language and build an android or iOS application to run the controls. 

* Need to research doing all of this in Android instead, could create a tablet application that can function as a standalone remote control system. Also might like to set up some IP based dimmers for lighting in the living room.
